# Overview

As a software engineer, I created this project to further my understanding of building graphical user interfaces. It serves as a small example focusing on design and gradient background effects within a window.

This software is a simple “Hello World” application with an enhanced visual appearance. It demonstrates basic concepts of setting up a window, applying a gradient background, and placing text widgets in a neat layout.

My purpose for creating this software was to learn more about event handling and drawing operations in a GUI framework. It also helped me practice structuring a project that can be easily extended for more complex features in the future.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used a modern Python integrated development environment (IDE) on a macOS system to build and test the application. Additionally, libraries and frameworks were managed via pip to ensure all dependencies were up to date.

The programming language used for this project is Python. Specifically, I utilized the PyQt5 framework to handle the graphical user interface elements.
